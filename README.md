Navbar Task

Create a navigation bar similar to the images shown in widerScreensNav.png and mobile_navBar.png

- Launch Chrome DevTools. On the Elements tab, click on the Toggle Device Mode icon
to go to the device mode.

- Build this navigation bar from scratch using the mobile-first approach. Make the
browser small or use the device mode in DevTools to ensure the navigation bar has
the right look and feel on mobile devices.

- Use media queries to re-style the navigation bar for tablets and wider screen. You can
use 768px as the breakpoint. Thatâ€™s a standard breakpoint for tablets.

RUBRIC 6 points
3 points for each navbar, one for tablets and one for wider screens as shown in the images
